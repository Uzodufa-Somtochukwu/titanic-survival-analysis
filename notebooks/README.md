# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most well-known shipwrecks in history.  
This project applies **data science and machine learning techniques** to explore the factors that influenced passenger survival and to build a baseline predictive model.

---

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand passenger demographics
- Identify key features associated with survival
- Build and evaluate a baseline machine learning model

---

## Dataset
- Public Titanic dataset (commonly sourced from Kaggle)
- Variables include passenger class, sex, age, fare, family size, and survival outcome

> Raw data files are not included in this repository.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## Project Structure

## Key Insights
- Survival rates were significantly higher among female passengers
- Higher passenger class was strongly associated with increased survival
- Younger passengers showed slightly higher survival probabilities

---

## Modeling
- Model: Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix

---

## Next Steps
- Feature engineering (family size, title extraction)
- Try additional models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
